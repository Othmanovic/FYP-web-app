My final year project in the school of Computing, faculty of Engineering in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia

UTM Online Printing System (UTM-OPS) is a web application system that provides the students with variety of shops with their rates and queue length in order to compare and choose among them so that students in University Technology Malaysia (UTM) can have more choices and better shops availability. In addition, Students will not need to any external storage. All you need to do is uploading your files into the system after choosing the most suitable shop for you and your documents will be printed for you in advance after you make the payment online.
